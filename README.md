TerminalHotkey is a program that runs in the background to define the hotkey Ctrl+Alt+T to access the Windows Terminal, it also defines the combination Ctrl+Alt+Shift+T as a hosrtcut to close itself. The principle is basic, it defines a keyboard hook to capture the keys and use it to check if the combination of keys are pressed.
